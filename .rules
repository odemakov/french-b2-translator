# Writing Rules

- Ask follow-up questions when you don't understand something
- Propose solutions when you have ideas, do not immediately start to implement them
- Do not use any emoji in the code, docs or any text
- Write clear and concise code
- Use proper indentation and formatting
- Use python 3.10 with type hints
